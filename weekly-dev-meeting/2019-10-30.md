## Discussion topics

### Berlin Meeting

- We worked in groups of 2;
- It was very helpful and we want to do it more often;
- Tsvi and Joshua worked on Tangle RFC;
- Thibault and Janis worked on Transaction & Bundle RFC;
- Alex and Samuel worked on PearlDiver/PoW RFC & Network RFC;

### Change in workflow - active RFC

- If a feature has blockers, we can put the RFC as "active" and start implementing it;
- We can then start working on the blockers at the same time;
- When blocker are done, update the initial RFC and get it merged;
- Allows us to quickly start publishing some code;

### Suggestion for RFCs - provide code examples

- Not a complete implementation, leave unimplemented;
- Have some code to make it more obvious how things are supposed to be used;
- Helps providing input for an implementation, early feedbacks on APIs;

### Standups

- Please always answer daily standup questions;
- Allows everyone to better understand what other members are doing even if unrelated to bee;
- Timezone issue especially for @LK, might ask @Dave;

### Impl in traits RFCs

- Do we want an RFC that only talks about the Trait and have one RFC for each impl ?;
- Or do we want a monolithic RFC with both Trait and impls ?;
- Both ways have pros and cons;
- Existence of an impl dictate the design of Traits...;
- Separation of concerns...;
- We all have different opinions on this;
- Decision to continue working on Trait RFC up to the point it's self-explanatory and we'll advise;

### Activation of Transaction & Bundle RFC [#20](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/20)

- Almost done after Berlin Meeting;
- Still has blockers;
- Needs review before going to the implementation phase;
- **We'll all focus on this PR this afternoon;**

### Status of Sponge RFC [#21](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/21)

- Having our own Trait or an existing Trait from the Rust community ? Our own, less dependencies;
    - Other crypto crates in mind: ring, libsodium
- [Sponge trait reference](https://github.com/wusyong/sponge-preivew/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L7) / [Implement trait example](https://github.com/wusyong/troika/blob/master/src/ftroika.rs#L124);
- Discussion of sponge-less Curl implementation;
- Needs associate type to let each implementation decide;
- Might want to provide verified/unverified methods (safe/unsafe in mind);
- Focus on Curl or Kerl over Troika;

### Status of PoW RFC [#19](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/19)

- PearlDiver is a mechanism used by PoW;
- Needs a hash function, a modifier, validator, input data type and output data type;
    - validator can be hashcash or hamming;
- Should PearlDiver return something or rely on the modification of the input ?;
- Almost done, not optimized, but it works;
- Abstract PoW type;

### Status of Tangle RFC [#23](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/23)

- Describe the API to interact and walk the Tangle;
- Makes use of Deref for a more handy consistent interface;
- Better solidification algorithm, removing the usual solidification thread;
- Each transaction has access to its approvers and approvees;
- Still not decided how to interact with database interface;
- Should make it async operation in the future;
- Traversal should be another RFC;
- Database should be another RFC, but keeping in mind it influences the cached part of the Tangle;
- Provide benchmarks between classic approach and new approach ?;

### Status of Network RFC

- Draft or PR is coming;
- Goal is to create a generic network interface;
- It should allow different type of connections at the same time;
- Should work with auto-peering or manual peering;
- There is a prototype, will be pushed soon;

### Status of Signing Scheme RFCs [#26](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/26)

- Started recently, still a lot to do;
- Will provide a Trait RFC and a WOTS impl RFC;
- Makes use of associate type appropriately;
- Design can be influenced by other RFCs e.g. Transaction;

### Status of Chronicle

- Doing profiling on async backend at the moment;
- Would like to have work stealing mechanism;
- Self-made runtime implementation, should take task parallelism in mind;
