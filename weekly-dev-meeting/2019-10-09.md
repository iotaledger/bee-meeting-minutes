## Discussion topics

### Slack vs Discord

- We are currently having discussions on Slack + pre-RFC on GitHub;
- Decision to move everything technical to Discord starting tomorrow 2019-10-10;
- pre-RFC on a public forum like Research Dep is doing ? Maybe even the same forum ?;

### Markdown column limit

- Long lines are annoying to review;
- We should not let GitHub wrap but break ourselves;
- Decided on 120 lines;

### Remote vs local Rust workshop

- Remote advised for people far from Europe (Canada + Taiwan);
- Hours are to be decided by the trainer so we'll have to adapt;

### TransactionBuilder

- The builder pattern is very common in Rust;
- Basically same fields but usually `Option<T>`;
- Build does several checks on the fields;
- Starts with an empty Transaction;
- Do we want to do Pow in the build step ? Or separate it ?;
- The overall opinion is that we should separate;
- It is pretty common in Rust to have different types for each step of the building process;
- Discussions on default values vs Options;
- Decision to use Options;
- `foo: builder.foo.unwrap_or(default)`, there's even an `unwrap_or_default()` method on `Option`;
- Decision to use the intermediate step `UnprovenTransaction`;
- To be renamed;

### Transaction

- Hash, trunk and branch should have same type;
- Some fields with different meaning share the same validations e.g address & hash -> Deref ?;
- Opinions on entangled's way of structuring transactions;

### Bundle

- Should Transaction and Bundle RFCs should be merged ? No;
- We should do flowcharts on the lifecycle of transactions and bundles;
- Bundle RFC will need to be modified following UnpowedTransaction proposal;
- `impl FromIterator<Transaction>` for bundle allows you to do `let my_bundle = [tx1, tx2, tx2].iter().collect()`;

### Tasks

- Everyone keep working on their tasks;
- Focus on the transaction RFC;
