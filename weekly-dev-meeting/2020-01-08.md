## Discussion topics

### Welcome back

- We hope you all had wonderful holidays!
- The team is catching up with what has been done during the last 2-3 weeks;
- A lot of things will happen Q1 2020 for bee: https://roadmap.iota.org/;
- We are expecting RFCs and code to be merged soon;

### State of RFC & Prototype: Cryptographic Hash Functions (Janis & Yu-Wei)

- Almost ready for review;
    - need to fix some nits (external sources for further reading, check facts about where hashes are used);
    - clarify the usage of `[u8]` or `[i8]`, and how they are verified;
- Reintroduced the `Sponge` interface: different type of sponges are being used for e.g. testnet and mainnet;
- No dependency -> public FCP at the end of the week;

### State of RFC & Prototype: Signing Scheme (Thibault)

- RFC is pretty much done, only needs cleaning and additional comments;
- Ready for reviews but dependent on Hash RFC for FCP;
- Prototype is done: interfaces + WOTS impl + ed25519 impl + MSS impl, only needs cleaning and testing;

### State of RFC & Prototype: Network (Samuel)

- TCP only for now, TCP stack with mpsc;
- Working on async prototype;
- Good overview of how things communicate with each others;
- Receiving of length denoted messages already implemented (enables receiving of different message types);
- Shouldn't take too long;
- Joshua to join Sam when he's done with his tasks;
- RFC will be updated after the prototype;

### State of RFC & Prototype: Storage (Tsvi)

- RFC updated and ready to be reviewed;
- Issues with async methods in Traits;
- Bottom-up approach to build the storage backend;
- Will need the Transaction Layout soon;

### State of RFC & Prototype: Tangle (Joshua)

- Introducing async is complex because solidification is serialized by nature;
- Currently helping Vlad on MAM's trits interface;

### State of RFC & Prototype: Chronicle (Louay & Bing-Yang)

- Goal is to have a better minimal runtime than Tokio;
- Database is still scyllaDB;
- Prototype by the end of January;
- Will start using bee when it's ready;
