## Discussion topics

### bee roadmap v0.1

- Thibault and Janis setup a roadmap last week;
- Tracking issue for each topic to let people tracking RFC and implementation status;
    - should be in bee repo;


#### Current Schedule:

- January:
  - Cryptographic primitives Sponge, Curl and Kerl
      - 6 months of cryptographic review in case of security
  - Network layer
- February:
  - Signing Scheme
  - Transactions and Bundles
  - PoW / PearlDiver
- March:
  - Tangle
- April
  - Gossip protocol
  - Consensus

### Preactivation of Transaction & Bundle RFC [#20](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/20)

- Janis quickly walk through the recent changes he did;
    - Various bundle buidler to meet different needs;
    - Users don't need to know the actual type;
- Discussion on timestamp. Timestamp it set before PoW, but it is not reliable since it can be spoof. It currently only serves as basic validation.
- Discuss on Parameterization. Transaction might able to do any hasher it wants and it will be broken. But it might also be a premature optimization;
- Remove generic stuff;

### Parameterization of bee and interfaces

- We will have RFC of Parameterization in the future;
- Modules need to be parameterized:
    - Sponge (or Hash);
    - Trits & Trytes;

### Assign two people to each RFC

The idea is to have 2 people responsible for each RFC. See bee-rfc to see who is assinged;


### General parameterized approach on PoW RFC [#19](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/19)

- Alex has a preview available here: [bee pow preview](https://github.com/Alex6323/bee-pow-preview)
- Make Pow modular, more abstraction layer and trait;
- Make it flexible like different input types and multi-thread;
- ATM some trait abstraction might not needed; Only PearlDiver requires to be generic;

### Expand Sponge RFC [#21](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/21)

- preview: [sponge](https://github.com/wusyong/sponge-preivew) / [curl-p](https://github.com/wusyong/curl-p) / [kerl](https://github.com/wusyong/Kerl)
- Expand RFC with implement Curl & Kerl;

### Tangle RFC

- async version is on the way;

### Storage RFC

- Tsvi is going to take it;

### Network RFC

- Different type of connection;
- Network would have various protocol which might need to seperate RFC(?);
- ATM only tcp is required, but generics would still make sense;
- Decision on dropping udp is still unclear.

### Tokio or Async std

- Chronicle is going to build its own async IO stack/executor;
    - Other features in tokio runtime are still needed;
