- Joshua Barretto
- Louay Kamel
- Alexander Schmidt
- Yu-Wei Wu

## Goals

+ Finding the right balance between RFC & Prototype;
+ Round table on crates progression;

## Discussion topics

### Balance between RFC and prototype (Janis & Thibault)

+ Remember to update the RFCs in tandem with updates in the prototypes;
    + The changes in the prototype should inform the RFC;
+ Code ends up in the bee repository by the RFC process;
+ Two issues:
    + Updating RFCs while working on prototypes;
    + Having reviews on finished RFCs;
+ Try and use Github project board to manage RFCs;
+ Janis will enforce the RFC process;

### State of the prototype (Alex)

+ On a good path to have a prototype up and running;
+ Workflow works well so far;
+ Janis to provide a format file for the repository, Alex to apply it everywhere;
+ First milestone: connect two bee nodes together;
+ Second milestone: send/validate handshake packets with mainnet nodes;

### State of crate: cryptographic hash functions (Janis & Yu-Wei)

+ Making the `trit -> bigint` more rusty and commenting it so that other people can understand it;
    + Should happen today or tomorrow;
+ Prototype is then updated and RFC right after;

### State of crate: signing scheme (Thibault)

+ Generalised the signing scheme seed to allow the new hybrid signing scheme;
    + Will leave the changes out of the RFC for now until the protocol is set in stone;
    + Generalisation will enter `bee` through a later RFC, expanding the signing scheme RFC;

### State of crate: transaction and bundles (Thibault)

+ Call with Janis about doing some design changes in the RFC;
+ Starts working on this this week;

### State of crate: network (Samuel)

+ Currently reducing complexity of interface;
+ Contributes to a clean interaction between the tasks;

### State of crate: storage (Tsvi)

+ Still working on SQLx backend implementation;
+ Planning on doing database benchmarks;

### State of crate: tangle (Joshua)

+ Tsvi and Joshua to get in touch to integrate the Storage trait into the Tangle;
+ Will get back on the Tangle as of next week (working on Trits API atm);

### State of crate: chronicle (Louay)

+ Implemented a supervisor tree on the actor model;
+ Graceful shutdown in progress;
+ Evaluate bastion;
