## Discussion topics

### Tokio switch

- Pros
    - Seems to be more mature, battle-tested;
    - `select!` macro is eventually fair;
    - Lots of existing frameworks depends on it;
- Cons
    - Have some similar API with inconsistent behaviour;
- Yu-Wei will investigate;
- Not really a priority at the moment though;

### Flume switch

- Flume can block by pausing the thread or deferring to an async runtime;
- Passing all the tests;
- Still quite experimental;
- We could start using it;

### Bundle miner

- Either a bee task or a client task:
    - if bee: Thibault
    - if client: Yu-Wei
- There is a Go prototype that just need to be ported to Rust;
