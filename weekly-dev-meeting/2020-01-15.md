## Discussion topics

### Bee prototype strategy and open communication (Alex)

+ Alex is responsible for the bee prototype;
+ The goal is to continuously merge crates prototype into a master repository;
+ Checks interoperability and gives early feedbacks;
+ The bee prototype repository is https://github.com/Alex6323/bee-p;
+ How can we seamlessly contribute a prototype ?;
     + Scenario 1: Alex owns master, everyone else creates a PR with changes or a new prototype, Alex merges;
         + Pros: Allows CI/Testing. Clearer to know when we're satisfied with our prototype;
         + Cons: Alex is more dependent on our own workflow. Can take longer until we notify Alex. Makes it harder for Alex to keep track of
           the different branches if he doesn't want to wait for PRs;
     + Scenario 2: Alex owns master, everyone else work on a branch, easily identifiable and constant, on the same repository;
         + Pros: Alex fetches work whenever he wants;
         + Cons: Lack of GitHub tools/utilities;
+ We can do scenario 1 if we commit to do frequent intermediate PRs and not only one at the very end of the prototype;
+ We can't afford to discover interoperability issues too late;
+ Alex will give feedbacks to the prototype owner;
+ The current bee prototype, `alex6232/bee-p`, is essentially a sketch of the `bee` repository with the missing
  parts replaced by quick and dirty preliminary versions or by components of the `iota.rs` library;
+ No CI/tests necessary for the prototype, it is intended to be quick and dirty;
+ The goal is to reach the same community involvment than Ict / GoShimmer / Hornet;

### State of crate: cryptographic hash functions (Janis & Yu-Wei)

+ Prototype almost finished, see [superfluffy/bee-hashes-preview](https://github.com/superfluffy/bee-hashes-preview);
+ Adding a couple of tests demonstrating the workflow;
+ Replicate some changes to the RFC;
+ Tests currently failing, investigating;

### State of crate: signing scheme (Thibault)

+ Signing scheme prototype is done;
    + Can be found at https://github.com/thibault-martinez/iota.rs/tree/master/bee-signing-scheme;
+ Is waiting for the hashes prototype and RFC to be done;
    + Will include it into the signing scheme RFC the moment these are done;
    + This will finalize the RFC;
+ Meeting soon with Wolfgang and Janis to talk about the new ed25519 signing scheme and how it can be included in
  the RFC;
    + The new signing scheme will be part of a future RFC (after the RFC proposing making it an official IOTA signing
      scheme is merged);

### State of crate: proof of work (Alex)

+ The prototype is ready;
+ RFC is not up to date yet;
+ Async proposal with futures ?;
+ Based on the C implementation;
+ Does it use the Sponge trait ? No ?;

### State of crate: network (Samuel)

+ Prototype progressing well;
+ Receiving/sending messages working;
+ Instances are able to share messages;
+ Using MPSC channels from futures crate;
+ Custom MPMC because unstable from async-std atm;
+ External MPMC crates doesn't offer async features;
+ Event/forward mechanism;

### State of crate: storage (Tsvi)

+ Implementing the storage backend in terms of SQLx using async-std;
+ Needs a week to come up with a prototype;
+ Please review the RFC;

### State of crate: chronicle (Louay & Bing-Yang)

+ Implementing on top of async tokio;
+ Async functions work as actors, and they are the heart of chronicle flow and use-cases;
+ Abstracting Cdrs(Cassandra Driver/Cql protocol) only as parsing(encoding/decoding) crate for actors;
+ Challanges with Prototyping because of Rust's Compiler;
+ Have a look at the storage RFC and maybe use the existing Traits ?;
