## Goals

+ Feedbacks on the prototype and workflow;
+ Round table on crates progression;

## Discussion topics

### State of the prototype (Thibault)

+ We are pretty happy with the prototype so far, it is already being useful to check interaction between crates;
    + e.g. started implementing Sponge/Curl/Trits into the Signing Scheme;
+ Alex to experiment with the network and possibly start spinning up nodes;
+ Please rebase on top of master from time to time;

### State of crate: cryptographic hash functions (Janis)

+ Typename `t243` -> `[t0, t1, t2, ..., t242]` similar to `i64`;
+ Kerl prototype by the end of the week;

### State of crate: signing scheme (Thibault)

+ Basically done, needs `Kerl` to be prototyped;
    + Tests are passing for everything that doesn't need `Kerl`;
+ Will spend 2 days reviewing current RFCs and prototypes;
+ Will then switch to gossip if no other crates need support;

### State of crate: network (Samuel)

+ Prototype is up in `bee-p:samuel/bee-network`;
    + Can setup a node, peer them, exchange messages;
    + Packet types compatible with current mainnet, however further testing is needed;
    + MPMC (multiple producer multiple consumer) is currently a workaround;
+ Working on graceful shutdown of server and individual read/write tasks;
+ Move tests and examples into either tests modules, or tests/examples folders;
+ Will update the RFC this week;
+ Implementing STING protocol already?;

### State of crate: storage (Tsvi)

+ SQLX implementation done;
+ Planning on adding benchmarks;
+ Setup script for the database;
+ Currently using iota.rs transactions, to be replaced soon;
+ We'll worry about KV storage after `v0.1`;
+ Active part of the tangle -> hashmap cache, non-active part of the tangle -> database;

### State of crate: ternary (Joshua)

+ Working on Trits API, PR is opened;
+ Async presentation ready -> Jan. 27th;
+ Moving back to the Tangle soon;
+ Use MIRI to cover soundness issues and unsafe code;

### State of crate: chronicle (Louay & Yu-Wei)

+ Prototype in progress;
+ Working on graceful shutdown;
+ Get connection from CQL crate;
+ Investigate implementation of Bee's Storage RFC;
+ Changes suggestions to the Storage RFC;
