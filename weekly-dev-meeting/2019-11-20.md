## Discussion topics

### Status of RFCs

#### Hashing/sponges [#21](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/21)

+ Move away from generic sponge trait;
+ Should add more methods to support different usage;
+ Other implementations (Pcurl, Ptrits...) should be in other RFCs;
+ Preview of Prtirs/Pcurl version is on the way;

#### Proof of Work [#19](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/19)

+ Same problem like Hashing RFC. PoW would use PCurl eventually;
+ Design with specific trit type in mind;

#### Networking [#27](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/27)

+ Discussion on async approach;
    + Try using async-std;
    + Tokio is still experimenting;
+ RFC should just demonstrate the use of asynchronous implementation;
    + Use Tokio/Async-std to make a point, but don't tie the RFC too closely to either
+ Luoay is also exploring create our own runtime;
