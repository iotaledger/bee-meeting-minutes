- Samuel Rufinatscha
- Tsvi Sabo

## Goals

- Establish a working groups organization;
- Round table on crates progression;

## Discussion topics

### Working groups organization (Thibault)

- Work together early on to ask questions + address potential design issues;
- One person alone shouldn't be responsible for a design;
- We should create working groups of 2 people at least;
- We should spend more time calling each others inside a working group;
- We'll establish the working groups right now;

### State of the prototype (Alex)

- Yu-Wei to join the WG;
- Trits API integrated in the prototype;
- Prototype itself didn't change much during last week;
- Prototype != v0.1.0;

### State of crate: cryptographic hash functions (Janis)

- Thibault to join the WG;
- Kerl done;
- Will transition to using the new Trits interface;
- Will move the binary-ternary conversion to the bee-ternary crate;

### State of crate: protocol (Thibault)

- Janis and Joshua to join the WG;
- Good understanding how the protocol will work together with the `netzwerk` crate;
- Good understanding how the gossip protocol will look like;
- Once network is merged into master, the protocol can start really advancing;
- Learning from what IRI/Hornet does well, and what we'd like to change;

### State of crate: ternary (Joshua)

- Janis to join the WG;
- Integration into bee-p, fully merged;
- `Serde` implemented for trits types;
- Still need to do `t3b1` in a compliant way;

### State of crate: tangle (Joshua)

- Tsvi, Alex and Sam to join the WG;

### State of crate: storage (Tsvi)

- Yu-Wei to join the WG;
- Started KV storage with sled;
- Will experiment with RocksDB as well (more conservative choice over sled);

### State of crate: bundle (Thibault)

- Tsvi, Yu-Wei, Janis to join WG;

### State of crate: network (Alex & Sam)

- Will replace the current implementation with the new one soon;
- Still one or two bugs to fix before (e.g. duplicate connections...);
- Refactoring/Cleaning;
- Examples already useable and working;
- MPMC replaced with a more efficient dispatcher;
- Easily extendable;

### State of crate: chronicle async runtime (Louay)

- Improved graceful shutdown design;
- Started implementation of the Ring;

### State of crate: chronicle node (Bing-Yang & Yu-Wei)

- Working on Chronicle integration
- Node-Stage integration done;
- Designing examples as tests (e.g. broker-node-queries interaction...);
- Broker-node interaction discussions;
