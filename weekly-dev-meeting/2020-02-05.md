## Goals

- Discuss bee prefix and warnings
- Round table on crates progression

## Discussion topics

### Bee prefix

- Should we remove the `bee` prefix from the directory names ?;
- No, makes it consistent with the crate names;
- Would keep the same names in Cargo too;

### Warnings in the prototype

- Currently a lot of warnings when building from root;
- Attributes to mute the warnings were added, we'll remove them;
- Solve unjustified warnings as soon as possible;
- Not necessary to reach for a perfectly clean build at this stage of the prototype;

### State of the prototype (Alex)

- Alex reviewed all commits from last week;
- Curl64 was renamed because confusing;
- Repository is ready for rustfmt;
- Transactions from iota.rs not used anymore;
- Clean way to initialize a bee node;
- Started working on Bee configuration;
- 3 VPS has been setup: GoShimmer, Hornet and Bee;
- Logger and Screen setup;
- Will remove the iota.rs constants dependency;

### State of crate: cryptographic hash functions (Janis)

- Remove a lot of code from the previous versions of trits <-> bigint conversions;
- Will write benchmarks;
- Kerl will immediately follow, today?;

### State of crate: transactions & bundles (Thibault)

- Working on making Transaction/Bundle and their builders RFC-compliant;
- Improved some UX issues from the RFC;
- Introduced the state machine design for Bundle builders;
- Removing most Default behaviours;

### State of crate: ternary (Joshua)

- Integrating the new Trits API to the repository;
- More challenging that planned;
- In review stage;

### State of crate: network (Samuel)

- Simplified the network interface;
- Started the RFC draft; [RFC: Networking layer](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/29)
- Joshua to have a look;
- Will work on message-type parsing;
- Two crates ? network and protocol;
- Will write some tests on sending/receiving/message-parsing;

### State of crate: chronicle (Louay & Bing-Yang & Yu-Wei)

- Challenged by rust compiler knowledge (actors, topologies...);
- Writing tests;
- Work on query-engine, paged query implemented;
- Some unsupported APIs by ScyllaDB;
- ZMQ crate to subscribe to IRI events, no crate currently supports async-std;
