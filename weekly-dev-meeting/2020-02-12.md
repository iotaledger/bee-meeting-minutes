## Discussion topics

### Mid-quarter roadmap progression (Thibault)

+ Good progression on the prototype itself;
+ Slow progression on the RFCs;
+ We need to come up with stricter objectives for a month to focus on;
+ We should not lose focus of the current objective;
+ We should specify what we expect exactly from the prototype for Q1;
+ Maybe produce some diagrams on the lifecycle of a node;

### RFC board and process (Thibault & Janis)

+ Start using the project board on Github, [bee-rfcs board](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/projects/1);
+ The prototype helps writing RFCs in a context;
+ When we reach a point when writing tests then maybe it's time to write RFC;

### State of the prototype (Alex)

+ Alex switched to network so not much happened on master;
+ Will have a look at Hornet's configuration file;

### State of crate: cryptographic hash functions (Janis)

+ t243 <-> b384 conversions;
+ Will push tomorrow;
+ Kerl will logically follow;

### State of crate: transactions & bundles (Thibault)

+ Currently being blocked by Kerl and Trits API;
+ When Trits API is done, we need to implement T3B3 on top of it;
+ Then change the Transaction trytes fields to Trits API;

### State of crate: protocol (Thibault)

+ Started implementing [protocol messages](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/blob/d16a3815271cdb4b53ff3c234ea706bf764e1847/text/0001-protocol-messages/0001-protocol-messages.md)
    + Legacy messages
    + STING messages
+ Handshake is currently the most important
    + If we successfully (de-)serialize a handshake packet we can connect to an Hornet/IRI node

### State of crate: ternary (Joshua)

+ Been writing unit tests;
+ Pretty much ready;

### State of crate: network (Alex)

+ Created another repository to prototype network, which is now public;
+ Alex provided feedbacks on Sam's proposal;
+ Makes it more Rust idiomatic;
+ Current impl is based off of an `async_std` tutorial impl, which is Client/Server, not P2P;
+ Current impl doesn't fit all our requirements;
+ Recommend an Event-driven architecture;
+ Joshua to have a look;

### State of crate: chronicle async runtime (Louay)

+ Event-driven;
+ Runtime can handle lifecycle of request/response & keepalive socket;
+ Supports worker-pool if needed;
+ Will work on global scylla ring;

### State of crate: chronicle node (Bing-Yang & Yu-Wei)

+ Implemented some API supported by CDRS;
+ API for IOTA nodes and databases;
+ Currently uses Tokyo runtime;
