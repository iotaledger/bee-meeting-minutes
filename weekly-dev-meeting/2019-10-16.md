## Discussion topics

### Bee team organization w/ Jakub

- A lot of effort to shape the team and processes;
- Bee took a very different approach from IRI right from the start;
- Very conscious decision can be taken;
- Janis and Thibault are officially asked to take up roles of leadership;
- We are all looking forward to see how Bee will evolve;
- Discussion about written daily stand-ups;
- Written weekly updates to be publicly published;

### Working efficiently with Draft PRs

- Open PR as a Draft as soon as a task is assigned;
- Allows the team and the community to follow the development of an RFC from scratch;
- Only the author should be able to undraft a PR;
- When undrafted, the author announce it to the team for reviews;
- We do not review a Draft PR because it produces too much noise;

### Discussing and launching FCP on Transaction/Bundle RFC

- Question regarding normalization and obsolete_tag;
- Question regarding methods in `BundleBuilder` and their documentation;
- Documentation on M-bug should be in RFC and during code implementation;
- Discussion about the removed `TransactionDraft`;
- There is still a mention of `TransactionBuilder`, we should make it opaque;
- Discussion on what should be put in `TransactionMeta` and how to implement it;
    - Note that it should be on server side;
    - Decision on `TransactionMeta` is not inside `Transaction` struct;
    - `TransactionMeta` probably needs another RFC;
- Discussion about whether to use error libraries or not;
    - There are lots of out there: failure, snafu, (thiserror+anyhow);
    - Libraries like these usually have some overheads, we should investigate the cost of using one;
    - Experience from entangled: errors by hand can easily get out of hands;
