## Discussion topics

### End of the prototype - Chrysalis (Thibault)

- We are in the process of tying all the crates together;
- A solidifying node should be available soon;
- IRI started implementing some Chrysalis components;
- We think it's wise to only work on Chrysalis components for Bee and not legacy components;
- Bee will probably only support White Flag right from the start;

### State of the prototype (Alex/Yu-Wei)

- Kerl got merged;
- Builds on nightly;
- Features on requests in bee-network;
- iota-conversion has been removed;
- bee-pow will need to be refactored in terms of the new ternary crate;
- Some opened PRs to merge;

### State of crate: crypto (Janis/Thibault)

- Kerl got merged;
- One remaining edge case (negative bigint addition) to be fixed;
- Will be fixed in next days;

### State of crate: protocol (Thibault/Janis/Joshua/Samuel)

- Has been completely refactored;
- New configuration object and builder;
- Now only waiting on tangle features;
- Transaction Worker is done, needs further testing;
- Will investigate the Transaction Worker cache;

### State of crate: ternary (Joshua/Janis)

- Send/Sync will be added to Trits/TritBuf;
- Impl some new utility traits from Rust std;
- Fix the build for nightly;

### State of crate: tangle (Joshua/Tsvi/Alex/Sam)

- Some complications related to async;
- Hash is now Copy;
- Basic API is ready to be merged;
- Tasks can now be split;

### State of crate: storage (Tsvi/Yu-Wei)

- Storage is fixed;
- PR to update to latest SQLx;
- Will now start implementing a RocksDB backend;

### State of crate: bundle (Thibault/Tsvi/Yu-Wei/Janis)

- TransactionField trait;
- Opened PR to convert trits to integers;

### State of crate: signing (Thibault/Yu-Wei/Alex)

- Got back to updating it in terms of recent Kerl;
- Kerl still has issues with some edge cases, so tests are still commented;

### State of crate: network (Alex/Sam)

- Refactoring, renaming, ...;
- Warnings free crate;
- IP whitelisting;
- Changed the URL parsing to handle IPV6;

### State of crate: snapshot (Thibault)

- Nothing done this week;
- Will add SEPs to the Tangle;

### State of crate: chronicle (Louay/Bing-Yang/Yu-Wei)

- Code clean and bug fix for the frame decoding/encoding part;
- API mod for the CQL part;
- Instead of directly using CDRS (Cassandra driver written in pure Rust), we now only use its frame decoding/encoding
part and integrate it w/ chronicle runtime;
