## Discussion topics

### IOTA.cafe

+ There's a new category for `bee` on [iota.cafe](https://iota.cafe);
+ Good topics to discuss there are:
    + pre-RFC,
    + extended conversation (to come back to it later and not lose it on discord or slack),
    + implementation questions (specific to iota, but can be rust-related).

### On generalization and coupling of modules

+ `v0.1`: make the crates as independent of each other as possible to move quickly;
    + prioritize testing and documentation over performance;
    + assume that all data is shared in the form of `t1b1` (one trit per byte), stored in some `&[u8]` slice;
    + if it's easier to implement some algorithm using, say, `t4b1`, then implement it thus, but have some extra logic
    to convert from `t1b1` to the encoding internal to the crate, and then back;
+ `v0.2`: unify the ternary interfaces to create a somewhat tighter coupling with a crate implementing some kind of `BinaryCodedTernary` interface.

### Binary coded ternary

The representation of ternary in terms of binary is the most fundamental aspect of `bee`.
It infects all other logic and blocks implementation of other crates, thus:

+ Start with `t1b1` to kick out version 0.1 (thus the decision to decouple modules as much as possible for `v0.1`, see the section on generalization).
+ Make binary coded ternary the main point of `bee v0.2`.

### Tangle experiments and async

+ async on higher components like network, storage, and gossip;

### Status of RFCs

#### Hashing/sponges [#21](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/21)

+ Make vectorized trits/ptrits a minor priority;
    + it works right now, but multiplexing still needs work;
+ Implement the basic version in terms of `t1b1`

#### Networking [#27](https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/27)

+ Propose an async interface;
+ Close the sync RFC, and reference it in a new async RFC (so people can compare both);
+ Prototype/experimentation coming;
