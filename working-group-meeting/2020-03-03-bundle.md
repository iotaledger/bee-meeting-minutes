# Working Group Meeting - Bundle - 2020-03-03

## Participants

- Thibault Martinez
- Janis Goldschmidt
- Yu-Wei Wu
- Tsvi Sabo

## Discussion topics

### Current roadblocks

- Transaction fields are currently `Trytes` (type from `iota.rs`);
- Incomplete Kerl and Signing Scheme;
- Lack of serialization/deserialization;

### Current needs

- Many crates obviously depend on it;
- Most pressing ones are Storage and Protocol;
- Serialization from/to different encodings;

### Cloneability of Transaction

- We don't want to be able to clone/copy transactions;
- Remove the `Clone` derivation which is a too convenient way to clone a transaction;
- It will make tests a bit more verbose but for greater good;

### Transaction fields encoding

- Currently `Trytes`;
- Specific: `struct Hash(TritBuf<T1B1Buf>)`;
    - Pros: way simpler for now;
    - Cons: will have to refactor (but we will have to refactor at some point anyway);
- Generic: `struct Hash<T: RawEncodingBuf = T1B1Buf>(TritBuf<T>)`
    - Pros: allows configure encodings, can be type aliased;
    - Cons: more immediate work;
- Decision to go specific on `T1B1` first

### Transaction fields `from_str`

- Not a core requirement of the bee Node;
- We should move out of them towards a generic `From`;
- Probably also relates to Serialize/Deserialize;

### What traits to implement/derive ?

- Default: No;
- Copy: No;
- Clone: Yes for fields, no for Transaction itself;
- Display: No;
- Debug: Yes;
- PartialEq, Eq: Yes;
- Hash: Probably No;

### Tasks

- Remove unwanted macros and trait derivations: Yu-Wei;
- Remove Clone derivation on Transaction: Yu-Wei;
- T3B1 implementation: Joshua ?;
- T5B1 implementation: Joshua ?;
- Serialization/Deserialization of `Transaction` from/to `TritBuf<T>`, with `T \in {T1B1, T2B1, ...}`: Yu-Wei / Thibault;
