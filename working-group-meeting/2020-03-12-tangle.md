# Working Group Meeting - Tangle - 2020-03-12

## Participants

- Joshua Barreto
- Tsvi Sabo
- Alexander Schmidt
- Samuel Rufinatscha

## Discussion topics

- refactor Tangle as a singleton, required to make it work at all
- putting the Tangle datastructure inside of an RwLock
- needs integration with the storage crate
- we have a single-threaded version
- need traversal of future and past cone
- currently using hashmap rather than graph library for simplicity reasons
- Async: What needs to access it? When? What kind of work? Common access patterns?
- Solidification: Separate "mid-solidification" state, propagated down to tangle main
- Solidification work: performed upon mutable access to the tangle. Pauseable?

### Next steps

- define types; getting basic structure ready
- components can be added on top
- distinct things to do:
    - solidification worker / data
    - vertex API
    - tangle structure & utility methods
    - storage worker (later)

### Current status
    * interop with storage crate: broken atm, need changes to bundle

### Current roadblocks
    * busy with other crates

### Tasks
    * split tasks as soon as types are there

```rust=
struct Tangle {
	main: TangleMain,
	solidification: SolidificationState,
}

impl Tangle {
	// Access the tangle through this method, requires doing work
	fn do_for(&self, f: impl FnOnce(&TangleMain)) {
		f(&self.main);
		self.soldification.do_work(&self.main, N);
	}
}

struct TangleMain {
	map: EvMap<Hash, Vertex>,
}

struct SolidificationState {
	verts: HashMap<Hash, Vertex>,
	verts_rev: HashMap<Hash, Vertex>,
}

impl SolidificationState {
	// Performs partial solidification
	fn do_work(main: &TangleMain, iters: usize) { .. }
}
```

```rust=
struct VertexMeta {
    hash: Hash,
    trunk: Hash,
    branch: Hash,
}

struct Vertex {
    tangle: &'static Tangle,
    meta: VertexMeta,
}

impl Vertex {
    async fn get_trunk(&self) -> Vertex {
        let meta = self.tangle.get_meta_of(self.meta.trunk).await;
        Vertex {
            tangle: self.tangle,
            meta,
        }
    }
}


let v: Vertex = Vertex::from_hash(hash);

let v1: Vertex = v.get_trunk().await;
```




```rust=
struct Vertex {
    ...
    last_access: AtomicU64,
}

struct Tangle {
    map: EvMap<Hash, Vertex>,
}

impl Tangle {
    fn get(&self, hash: Hash) -> &Vertex {
        let v = self.map.get(&hash);
        v.last_access.store(ctime, Ordering::Relaxed);
        v
    }
}
```
