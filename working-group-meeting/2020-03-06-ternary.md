# WG Meeting - Ternary - 2020-03-06

## Participants

- Joshua Barretto
- Richard Janis Goldschmidt

## Discussion topics

+ How to encode trytes?
+ How to relate trytes and `T3B1` (three trits per byte)?
+ How to make `T5B1` fit (encoding that iota uses to send messages over the wire)?
+ How to make this work with the current `TritBuf` and`Trits` designs?

## Results

+ We will introduce `TryteBuf` and `Trytes` types using `TritBuf` and `Trits` underneath;
    + The design will be inspired by how `String` and `str` are fundamentally just slices of `u8`
+ Have `TritBuf<T, U>` and `Trits<T, U>` take generic type parameters `T` and `U`, where `T` will
  be the encoding (how many trits per byte), and `U` the ternary type (balanced, unbalanced).
    + The current implementation makes the ternary type part of the encoding, so that one has,
    for example, `T = T1B1Buf<U>`. However, ternary type and encoding should be independent.

## Tasks

+ Joshua will refactor `TritBuf` and `Trits` and implement `TryteBuf` and `Trytes` in terms of a `T3B1` encoding.
+ A similar design will be done for `T5B1`.
