## Discussion topics

### Current status

#### What is implemented?
- All relevant abstractions are here;
- Relatively intuitive; API is straight-forward (CommandSender; EventSub; Shutdown) and fullfills the needs;
- Channel based architecture; actors used to avoid locks;
- Fully based on async-std (e.g. not mixed with tokio, ...);
- All relevant events are implemented (events can be added on desire if needed);
- Sending/receiving is working; adding of peers is working;
- Interaction (API) with networking-layer working;
- Graceful shutdown is implemented;

#### What is missing?
- Removal of 'is_broken', 'is_not_broken' TcpConnection API;
- Proper error handling;
- Optimizations (e.g. split tcp stream, less cloning);
- Detection of when a peer stalled (not that relevant, can be added later);
- Unit and integration testing;
- Integration in bee-p;

### Current roadblocks
- handling duplicate connections;

### Recognizing duplicate connections
- Duplicate connections might be detected in the protocol layer and are not necessarly topic of the networking layer;
- Has to be compatible with the current mainet;
- Checking in detail was Hornet and IRI is doing;

### Removement of the `is_broken` API
- Currently before reading/writing messages it will be checked if connections are still alive;
- Agreed that this doesn't necessarly works in every case and therefore it makes sense to handle errors directly on reading/writing;

### Splitting read/write in separate actors
- The reading and writing of messages will be split into their separate actors;
- Contributes to concurrency;
- Will be implemented;

### The use of independent connections for read and write
- Advantages:
    - will be more performant as reads and writes can happen concurrently;
- Disadvantages:
    - adds complexity; keeping track of related connections might introduce difficulties;
    - the termination of sessions needs to be adjusted;
- Might be considered for future optimizations;

### Update underlying connections on failure;
- Sessions to certain peers could be keept alive, even if the underlying connection fails;
- Adds however some complexity; connections need to be replaced when they fail;
- Needs some more brainstorming if advantages outweight disadvantages;

### When to shutdown read/writer halves?
- Shutdown should be done first on write-tasks and then read-tasks;
- The buffer of read_tasks should read-in first before terminating the connection;

### What should PeerId be derived from?
- We need to differ between IOTA Node IDs (introduced in upper layers), local-generated and assigned UUIDs, or sockets;
- A socket represents/identifies already the communication link;
- Information of the socket (e.g. host, port, protocol) could be very well suited to use to identify the endpoint;
- For now ip:port therefore fullfills the requirments;
