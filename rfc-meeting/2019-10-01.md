## Discussion topics

Reposted from Slack.

> 1. Start with T5B1 and treat it as any other encoding. Data comes in, we unpack it where necessary into an internal, rust memory model
> 2. Once we have this going, we can do the same with T9B2, just deserializing it and using the internal memory model unchanged.
> 3. Once this is done, treating data coming in from different ports is a solved problem.
> 4. Create an optimized fast path where operations are directly done on the T9B2 stream.

### Trits RFC

https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/10

- There has been a lot of discussions on Slack recently about how to approach the Trits interface;
- Some of us have design ideas due to experience working with IOTA nodes, client and tools;
- Some raise the fact that we do not know the full extent of the trits contract yet;
- Do we actually need to define an interface (in the “Trait” sense) ?;
- The proposed idea is to start specifically and then apply genericity later with full knowledge of the requirements;
- Concerns about moving from specification to genericity are raised;
- The Rust experts are confident enough it won't be an issue at all;
- We should first reach quality crates with the current state of the mainnet and the improve on;
- We don't want to loose type safety on the underlying encoding;
- Decision to close the current Trits RFC taken;
- Focus on T1B1 and T5B1 RFCs;

### Transaction RFC

https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/pull/3

- Concerns about using raw Strings for trinary fields;
- Talking about on-the-fly buffering of fields;
- Discussion about fixed-size arrays;
- Focus on the model RFC PR;

### Network communication

- As a start we accept the fact that wire encoding is T5B1 and we work with it;
- Implementations based on another encoding (T9B2) will be considered later;
- Discussion on how to interpret incoming bytes stream;
- Discussion on the future of the wire (e.g. PB3);
